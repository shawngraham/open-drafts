# open-drafts

Sometimes I write stuff that I'd be happy to have other people take a look at before publication. I'm going to put it here. If you cite the draft version, make sure you note the location of the final version, and cite that as well. Cite the draft version's location in this repo.

If you wish to leave a comment, just click on the 'issues' link above and leave me a note.

Cheers!
